# Eren Discord Bot ⚔️

A discord bot of Eren Yeager for my weeb friends. Made with discord.js. I regret everything.

## Usage

### Standard

All you have to do is mention eren in the message and he'll reply with one of the quotes from the _standardReplies_ array in the _replies.js_ file.

### Yes or No

You can ask Eren a 'yes or no' question by simply saying "eren yes or no" and he will reply with either a yes or a no. This is pretty straight forward.

### SIMP Mode

One of my friends is a huge Eren Yeager SIMP. So this mode was made for her. Whenever she calls Eren (Standard) the responses for her are different.

    <li>Eren can send a random picture of himself in the channel.</li>
    <li>Can serve as a music bot since most are being taken down.</li>
    <li>OpenAI implementation.</li>
    <li>Improve this README cause this was done lazily lol</li>
</ul>
