# Eren Discord Bot ⚔️

A Discord bot for my weeb friends. Made for fun and self-training.

## Usage

#### Standard Mode

All you have to do is mention eren in the message and he'll reply with one of the quotes from the quotes array in the quotes.js file.

#### Yes or No Mode

You can ask Eren a 'yes or no' question by simply saying "eren yes or no" and he will reply with either a yes or a no. This is pretty straight forward.

### SIMP Mode

One of my friends is a huge Eren Yeager SIMP. So this mode was made for her. Whenever she calls Eren (Standard Mode) the responses for her are different.

    <li>Can serve as a music bot since most are being taken down.</li>
    <li>OpenAI implementation.</li>
    <li>Improve this README cause this was done lazily lol</li>
</ul>
